## Ad-Blocking

Refer to [`/blocklists/baseline`](/blocklists/baseline.txt) to view the lists themselves.

For Ad blocking and privacy protection, I use StevenBlack's dns-blocklist in conjuction with Hagezi's for maximizing privacy and network-wide adblocking.

I also have additional NSFW and Roku TV protection enabled.
